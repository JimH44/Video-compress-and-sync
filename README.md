# Video-compress-and-sync
Video-compress-and-sync is a software tool designed to compress videos with HandBrake and synchronize them to another computer using Resilio Sync. It provides a convenient way to reduce the file size of videos without compromising their quality. This is especially useful when you need to share videos over limited bandwidth networks or store them on devices with limited storage capacity.

The first stage will run only on Windows computers, using powershell and cmd scripts.

The compression settings will be hard-wired into the scripts so users less familiar with computers wonâ€™t have to make these decisions.

Colleagues can give feedback, and the developers can make improvements to their work, and then use a similar script to copy the full-sized video to the sync folder when development is finished.
